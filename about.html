    <h1>About Valence</h1>
    <p>
      Valence was founded to help organisations reimagine leadership and performance in a rapidly evolving world. Our approach is grounded in more than 25 years of international experience in talent strategy, organisational transformation, and human-AI collaboration at board level. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Our founder, <strong>Daniela Nazzaro</strong>, is a globally recognised HR executive and researcher, combining practical expertise from senior roles in aviation, energy, and public sector firms with academic insight drawn from her PhD research on AI in the boardroom. Daniela has worked with boards and leadership teams across Europe and the Middle East, contributing to IPO readiness, performance frameworks, and cultural transformation in complex environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valence stands for clarity, composure, and collaboration in the face of uncertainty. We bring a systems-psychodynamic lens to our advisory work, helping leaders understand the unseen dynamics shaping decision-making, engagement, and innovation.
